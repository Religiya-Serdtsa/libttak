## Context Ownership Rules
Exactly one side owns the locks. When `__TTAK_CTX_USE_FIRST__` is active, the second side may read shared memory but must never free or reassign pointers.

## Bridge Lock Purpose
The bridge mutex serializes every callback. Without it, both owners might try to mutate shared buffers simultaneously, causing use-after-free bugs.

## Macro Discipline
All unsafe toggles follow the `__TTAK_*__` naming rule. Forgetting the trailing double underscore leaves the project in an undefined configuration.

## When Not to Use Unsafe
Do not route routine traffic through unsafe helpers. Only use them when two owners must touch the same shared payload and no other interface fits.

## Region Move Patterns
`ttak_unsafe_region_move()` is the default destructive move: dst must be empty, src becomes canonical empty immediately after. Use this whenever both regions share the same allocator + ctx.

## Region Adopt Pattern
`ttak_unsafe_region_adopt()` lets you import raw `(ptr, size, cap)` triples, but once adopted the caller is responsible for matching the original allocator. Never adopt buffers with unknown provenance.

## Region Steal Pattern
`ttak_unsafe_region_steal()` overwrites dst regardless of its previous contents. It is the “overwrite lifecycle” tool—call it only when you intentionally want to drop dst’s old state without cleanup.
