## Scheduler Overview
Every worker job flows through the priority queue. Lower `priority` value runs first. The scheduler wakes sleeping threads whenever new work arrives.

## Ownership Basics
Use `ttak_owner_t` to register resources and execute callbacks. Locks sit inside the owner; acquire them through `ttak_owner_execute` rather than manually.

## Memory Tree Cleanup
Epoch GC rotates allocations: register blocks, bump epochs, let `ttak_mem_tree_perform_cleanup` reclaim old nodes. Never free memory outside the owner that created it.

## Big Integer Policy
`ttak_sum_proper_divisors_big()` starts in fast mode. On any `assign/export/arith` failure it logs the stage, resets targets, and retries via the safe generic path.

## Thread Pool Contracts
`ttak_thread_pool_submit_task` accepts a function and context. It must be paired with `ttak_future_wait` if you need the result; otherwise tasks run fire-and-forget.

## Logging Etiquette
Attach a logger when you need run-time breadcrumbs. Keep each message short so collectors (like the helper) can parse them easily.
