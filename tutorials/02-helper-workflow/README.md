# Tutorial 02 – Helper Workflow

This folder keeps the workflow notes, checkpoints, and helper commands that correspond to [`modules/02-helper-workflow`](../modules/02-helper-workflow/README.md).

## Checklist

1. Build the helper tool:
   ```bash
   cd tutorials/helper
   make
   ```
2. Read `libttak.hlp` with the tool so you can page through the concise API reference while cloning modules:
   ```bash
   ./helper ../libttak.hlp
   ```
3. If you plan to cover the unsafe appendices, also open the companion file under `DANGEROUS/`.
4. Capture confusing sections with the helper’s “mark explanation” shortcut so you can look them up again when writing code.
5. Document the commands you ran and the shortcuts you discovered in this folder (e.g., keep a `NOTES.md` or shell history snippet as you progress).

The goal is to leave Lesson 02 with the helper muscle-memory in place so that the rest of the clone path feels frictionless.
