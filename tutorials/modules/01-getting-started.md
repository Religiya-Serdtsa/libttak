# 01 – Getting Started

**Focus:** Prepare your workspace, skim the clone path, and stage a scratch branch for the tutorial runs.

**Source material:**
- `tutorials/README.md`
- `tutorials/CLONE_PATH.md`
- `README.md`

## Steps
1. Read the root `README.md` to understand project goals and supported toolchains.
1. Open `tutorials/CLONE_PATH.md` and skim the nine stages so you know what subsystems are covered.
1. Create a fresh branch or tag in your fork so every lesson can end with a clean commit/diff.
1. Note which tests or binaries need to run for your platform (record them in your own log).

## Checks
- `git status` shows no stray edits before you begin the first clone exercise.
- You have a scratch doc where you can paste `What I learned` notes for every lesson.

## Notes
- Treat the lessons as checkpoints—resist the urge to jump back and forth or you will lose the incremental guarantees.
