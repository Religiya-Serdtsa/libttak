# BigScript Language Course

Welcome to the BigScript language course! BigScript is a custom-built, lightweight scripting language designed for mathematical computations within the `libttak` ecosystem. It supports high-precision integers (BigInt), real numbers (BigReal), and complex numbers (BigComplex).

## Course Syllabus

1.  **[01-getting-started](./01-getting-started/README.md)**: Introduction to BigScript, the `main` function, and basic execution.
2.  **[02-variables-arithmetic](./02-variables-arithmetic/README.md)**: Variable declarations with `let` and basic arithmetic operators.
3.  **[03-control-flow](./03-control-flow/README.md)**: Conditional logic using `if` statements.
4.  **[04-builtins](./04-builtins/README.md)**: Using built-in functions like `s(n)` for sum of divisors.
5.  **[05-complex-math](./05-complex-math/README.md)**: Working with real and complex numbers.

## How to Run BigScript

BigScript is typically embedded in a C application. Each tutorial includes a `main.c` file that demonstrates how to compile and execute BigScript source code using the `libttak` API.

To run the examples:
1. Ensure `libttak` is installed on your system.
2. Go to the specific tutorial directory.
3. Compile the `main.c` using the provided instructions.
4. Run the resulting executable.
