# LibTTAK Benchmark Suite

This directory contains performance testing utilities and stress tests for the LibTTAK subsystems.

## Core Benchmarks

### 1. TTL Cache Multi-threaded Benchmark
Located in `ttl-cache-multithread-bench/`.
- **Focus:** Lock-free shared memory throughput under heavy churn.
- **Strategy:** Uses Choi Seok-jeong's OLS principle to achieve extreme Ops/s by trading off RSS.
- **Peak Result:** **29.2M Ops/s** (Lock-Free Shards).

### 2. General Benchmark Hub (`ttak_bench.c`)
- **Focus:** Micro-benchmarking core primitives (allocators, atomics, math).

## Architectural Philosophy

We prioritize **predictable latency** and **massive throughput** over minimal memory footprint. 
- Traditional C libraries often sacrifice Ops/s to save a few kilobytes of RAM. 
- LibTTAK reverses this: we use segmented memory structures and deterministic isolation to ensure that synchronization never becomes a CPU bottleneck.

## Analysis Tools

Use the `visualize_memory_calls.py` script in the root `scripts/` directory to analyze allocation patterns generated by these benchmarks.
